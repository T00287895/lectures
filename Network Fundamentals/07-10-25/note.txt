The Three-Way Handshake:
- SYN - (Synchronize) Initiates a connection
- FIN - (Final) Cleanly terminates a connection
- ACK - Acknowledges received data

Sequence and Acknowledgment Numbers
The client on either side of a TCP session maintains a 32-bit sequence number it uses to keep track of
how much data it has sent. This sequence number is included on each transmitted packet, and
acknowledged by the opposite host as an acknowledgment number to inform the sending host that the
transmitted data was received successfully


When a host initiates a TCP session, its initial sequence number is effectively random; it may be any
value between 0 and 4,294,967,295, inclusive
