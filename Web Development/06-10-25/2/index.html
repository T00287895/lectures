            What is the Museum
        </h2>

        <p>
            Not only is the museum a trailblazing cultural capital project for UCD, it also allows both
            partners to expand beyond their traditional physical spaces. Through collaborative
            programming and promotion, MoLI will act as a catalyst through which to explore deeper
            links between UCD and the National Library in terms of collections, research, education and
            networks ‐ all the while engaging the public with their exceptional collections and
            scholarship through a vibrant new visitor attraction. The museums development has also been
            made possible through significant capital support from <span class="accent-text">Failte Ireland, Irelands tourism</span>
            development authority. You can find out more about our visionary partners below
